		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite blogs to read is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tim Bray&#x27;s Ongoing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - and this is a funny lead in 
to my first music post, because Tim is very much a technophile (for instance, he was recently &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxjournal.com&#x2F;issue&#x2F;151&quot;&gt;featured on the cover of 
Linux Journal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and on the inside too!). One of my favourite recurring themes is 
his &amp;quot;5✭♫&amp;quot; posts, in which he expounds on various musics that he listens to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the title looks broken, you should &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.google.com&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;toolbar&#x2F;bundle&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Get Firefox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s the simplest 
way to fix it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of thievery Open Source Ideas, I&#x27;m going to implement something similar. Right now it&#x27;s called &amp;quot;5✭ 
Fridays&amp;quot; and I&#x27;m going to tell you a bit about what I&#x27;m listening to... and at this moment it&#x27;s the Misfits (warning: 
the Misfits may be offensive).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;rock&#x2F;TheMisfits.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Logo for the Misfits&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfits are a great punk band. I&#x27;ll tell you right now that, even though I&#x27;m &lt;em&gt;in&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a punk band, it&#x27;s not a genre of 
music that I listen to regularly. Punk&#x27;s great, but I tend to want a bit more, um, &lt;em&gt;music&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in my music. There&#x27;s often a 
wall of sound and some yelling, and lots of double kick drum riffs, and a bass player that rakes the strings constantly, 
and it gets old quick. Also, even though I have a lot of rage, it&#x27;s mostly a quiet, vitriolic, smoldering rage that 
lends itself more to Metal or Franz Liszt. I&#x27;m not &amp;quot;anti-establishment&amp;quot; either; the man&#x27;s not keeping me down and I 
don&#x27;t have a yearning for anarchy. The Misfits carve right through all the problems that I have by using angry but 
harmonic guitars and establishing strong melodic vocals singing B-movie themed lyrics that are as apt to make you laugh 
as to incite anger in you. Here&#x27;s &amp;quot;Resurrection&amp;quot; (beware the mild sacrilege)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications inside of me reminds me that my heart won&#x27;t always 
beat The ugly face of death that&#x27;s smiling at my rotting teeth&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will die here in this sorrow 
I was waiting for tomorrow 
Palpitate the pulse until you 
feel 
my 
heart explode against the wall&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about me, Laugh about me cry about me... nail me to the cross 
I&#x27;ll be a martyr for the hated, the weak, the ugly, the lost&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will die here in this sorrow 
I won&#x27;t wait for tomorrow 
Palpitate the pulse until you 
resurrect 
my 
soul from the wall&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zombie much? To go with this, they have an astoundingly catchy melody and a powerful guitar riff, which is one of the 
most used chord progressions in history - but it works. It&#x27;s got a beat that&#x27;s hard to, well, beat, and it gets my head 
bobbing along every time I hear the song.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfits have this tendency to eschew writing lots of lyrics, which may be a biproduct of the fact that their songs 
tend to be under two minutes in length. &amp;quot;Resurrection&amp;quot; runs 1:29 and goes all-out for the duration. Another Misfits song 
that is amongst my favourites is &amp;quot;The Haunting&amp;quot; which clocks in at 1:27 and is basically a 40 second song with a repeat. 
It&#x27;s not a complicated song, but they&#x27;re not a complicated band, and sometimes it&#x27;s not about complication; the gestalt 
is more than the sum of its parts. There are only five chords in &amp;quot;The Haunting&amp;quot;, but they&#x27;re the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; five chords, 
and they&#x27;re supported by the powerful melody and the intense energy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in trying punk out for a spin, but want less noise and more melody, as many people often do, you 
would be hardpressed to find a better package than the Misfits. Besides, if you don&#x27;t like them, the song will be done 
in just a minute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
