<p>Hello all! I got an interesting email from one **[redacted]**Â about my my photo <a href="/sunny-skies-10/">Sunny Skies</a>. Here is the email, with Trevor's email taken out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe we have been in contact before. My picture, &quot;Sunny Skies&quot; is still up on your website. I would appreciate this being taken down, or at least some credit given. The reason I am ticked off about this is because that everyone on your comments page thinks that you took it, when we both know that is a lie. If this is not taken down within the month, further action will be taken.</p>
<p>Thanks, [redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few things wrong with this email.</p>
<ol>
<li>I took this picture. I still have the camera somewhere, and I definitely have the original. I'm anal about pictures - I never delete them.</li>
<li>I have never heard from [redacted]Â before. Sounds scammy to me.</li>
<li>I hate vague threats about copyright infringement, especially when there's no infringement.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hastily penned a response, and just as hastily deleted it. It takes a bit of effort, but it doesn't hurt anyone to be polite, right? Here is my response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello [redacted],</p>
<p>We have not been in contact before; this is the first I've heard from you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think there is some kind of confusion. While you may have a similar picture, Sunny Skies is one of mine; I still have the original and the camera that it was taken on, and the memory card that it was originally written to. I take false allegations about copyright infringement very seriously, and I do not appreciate being called a liar.</p>
<p>If you wish to pursue this matter further, please note that I will be making all contact between us public on my blog. I will take further contact to mean that you agree to my publishing of emails, letters, or any other form of communication.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andrew Phoenix</p>

<p>I hope that stays within the bounds of civility. I was pretty angry when first reading; getting a take down notice regarding a photo that I took is aggravating, and it is even more so because this is one of my most pirated photos. It is used without attribution a lot - <a href="http://www.tineye.com">TinEye</a> highlights just how much.</p>
<p>I guess it is time to wait and see what happens.</p>
