<p><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> is an invaluable tool for developers that don't have a budget for proprietary software. You can find a lot of useful bits and pieces there, not to mention wholes and entires, that are incredibly useful for whatever your software needs are. As a staunch supporter of OSS, I'd say I was a fan.</p>
<p>Well, until today. Today we find the wrench in the works.</p>
<p>I was interested in the software behind Sourceforge itself - the code that makes this a great repository for thousands upon thousands of projects - because I'd like to set up something somewhat similar for a few projects of interest to me. I was shocked and amazed to find out that <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=10382&amp;group_id=39306">Sourceforge itself is no longer Open Source</a>! The salient points from the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>SourceForge was Open until 2001 (and the 2.7 branch remains Open)</li>
<li>It was made proprietary because of change to the developer's &quot;core business from systems and services to software, and repeated instances of use and extension of the Open Source codebase by companies who declined to share their improvements.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Bemused by the mildly delicious yet decidedly offputting irony of this situation, I did a bit of research and have come across a few more solutions, including one that is very promising: <a href="http://www.gforge.org">GForge</a>. Gforge seems to be the continuation of SourceForge under the GPL and as such, it has much going for it right off the bat; it's similar to SourceForge, it's not chalk-full of irony, and it has a fair community devoted to it. If you need a (blank)Forge of your own, I would certainly recommend trying this one out... and then reporting back to me on your overall impression.</p>
