<p>I had a thought, which I'm finding difficult to complete. It goes something like this.</p>
<p>My partner's father is not very good with computers. I don't think he really gets them, so he often will ask my partner for help with the computer. Now, my partner's no whiz-kid with computers, so whenever she has a crazy problem she'll ask me to fix it. I'm pretty good with computers - I work with them all day every day. However, when I can't answer something, I'll ask <a href="http://blog.ccharles.ca">Chris</a> about how to fix my problem. I'm not sure who he goes to for answers - the next step up the chain would have to be someone like Linux Torvalds, and I don't think they know each other.</p>
<p>What's my point, you're asking? It's that to someone else, you may be a computer genius. But then I got to thinking about it, and it's really not just related to computers. You could do it with any particular subject.</p>
<p>So, on the grand scheme of things, you may be an expert compared to someone else.</p>
