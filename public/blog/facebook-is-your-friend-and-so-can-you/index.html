<p><em>This is a blog post that I started in around 2008. I'm going to post it, and then hopefully follow up with my more current thoughts on Social networking.</em></p>
<p>Social Networking. That's one of those buzzwords that I almost cringe when I hear.</p>
<p>There is a gap in Social Networking, and it's right in the middle. When you fall through it, you start to think of Facebook as an <em>end point</em> instead of a starting point. You think Twitter is actually a place to hang out with your friends. You think that Myspace... well, unless you think that Myspace is garbage, you're probably not thinking, and we'll leave that one alone.</p>
<p>The gap in Social Networking is where all the people who don't <strong>get it</strong> are hanging out. They're the people who keep sending you Farmville invitations and wonder why you're not jumping all over their need for irrigation. For them, the games are a way of hanging out with their friends online. A need to connect like this will prompt people to set their status to something like &quot;nothing to report&quot; which makes everyone else wonder why you'd actually make a status update like that. Why continue updating, when you've admitted that there's nothing left to say?</p>
<p>I'm not going to wax poetic on the transcendental need to shout out that we exist, or by the ennui of hanging out in a virtual world. But what is Social Networking actually for? It's actually pretty simple: Social Networking, in most cases, is just a synonym for Marketing. For most intents and purposes, Social Networking <em>is</em> just a tool to shout out <strong>I Exist!</strong> But it's no substitute for getting outside and actually talking to your friends (he says in his blog post).</p>
<p>I'm not saying that social sites are bad. I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of TheMyFace, but I use Twitter pretty extensively. So I'm a fan of social networking, but I also hate social networking.</p>
<p><em>And that's about when I lost steam with my rant on Social Networking. You can still find me on TheMyFace if you look hard, but it's better to find me on the TweetMaker: <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewphoenix">@andrewphoenix</a></em></p>
