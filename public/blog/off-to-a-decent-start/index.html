<p>I think I'm off to a good start. Last night I rode the bike for a while. Here's the route:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cycle/path1.gif" alt="the bicycle path I'm taking" /></p>
<p>It's not very long, but it's pretty decent - got some little uphills and downhills, some cycling on road and off (one fairly intrepit bit across the back of Zehrs to the west end community centre), and it's mostly a sprint. It's about 2.5 - 3 km by my estimation and I spend about 10 minutes at it. This will likely be my default &quot;workout&quot; bike ride, but it might just be too short.</p>
<p>The non-cycle workout last night consisted of 50 crunches (I think that's the word for them - you lay on your back and bring your knees up while doing a very short curl-up with your upper body), 40 light weight curls (per arm), 20 pushups (oh my god, these were hard - I'm so out of shape) 1 very, very difficult chin-up and some holding exercises. The holding exercises are ones that I've always done - you hold a weight out with your arms parallel to the ground for 30 seconds (I use the same weight for these as the curls - it's about 4 kg).</p>
<p>This morning was just too cold for a long bike ride (or even the short one that I'd planned on). I went up to the corner and back (about .6 km) and was freezing cold by the time I got home. Instead I did 100 crunches, 10 push-ups, 20 curls (per arm), and 2 minutes of jumping jacks. Then a hot shower.</p>
