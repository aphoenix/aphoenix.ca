<p>Creative Writing - it's that thing that most of us did in grade school, usually accompanied by a vague sense of forboding and a desire to do something else. It tends to be a fairly personal thing to do and is difficult for a lot of people to share.</p>
<p>Well, everyone who knows me knows that I have no shame. It's just not part of my genetic makeup. I'll get up on a stage and do just about anything if I think it will entertain people; that's part of the draw of writing a blog. In fact, a blog is really just a different kind of stage, one that has a soft filter of anonymity that one can almost hide behind. Of course, mine's an incredibly soft filter - you can find out my name on the About page and you can google me to find out anything about me you'd ever want to know.</p>
<p>Wow, that was quite the tangeant.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I'm going to use this stage (blog) to perform (write creatively). And you can comment and tear apart what I say as much as you want. I'm going to try to post a piece once per month.</p>
