<p>I'm talking about <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> at tonight's <a href="http://www.guelphcoffeeandcode.org">Guelph Coffee and Code</a>. My talk is going to be short, but here's the main talking points.</p>
<h3 id="lenhard-euler-mathematician">Lenhard Euler: Mathematician</h3>
<p>Euler (pronounced &quot;Canada's Worst Hockey Team that's not The Senators&quot;) was a Mathematician in the 1700s. He was a genius, and he helped shape the world of mathematics that we know and love today. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler">Euler on Wikipedia</a> for more in depth info about the fellow.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-this-all-about">What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Project Euler is gets you to combine mathematical insights with computer programming in an effort to find answers to a series of over 300 problems. It's not tied to a particular language, though there are some languages that will serve you better than others. It's all about finding the answer in an elegant fashion.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Project Euler will help you to identify areas of interest for you, and to make you a better all around programmer (and mathematician). There's a ton of different subjects that are covered, and it's an opportunity to push your self in new directions.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-do-an-example">Let's do an example!</h3>
<p>Sure thing! Look at Question #1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add all the natural numbers below one thousand that are multiples of 3 or 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not hard right? Make a loop that goes from 1 to 1000, and for each number check if it's divisible by 3 or divisible by 5. If it is, add it to a running sum. Pseudocode looks something like this:</p>
<p>x=1<br />
sum=0<br />
while x is under 1001<br />
    if x is a multiple of 3 then sum = sum + x<br />
    if x is a multiple of 5 then sum = sum + x</p>
<p>And at the end return sum. Does that give the right answer? Are we forgetting something?</p>
<p>Of course, if x is a multiple of both 3 and 5, then we've counted it twice. We can fix that in a few ways, like subtracting off x one time if it's a multiple of 3 and 5.</p>
<p>if x is a multiple of 3 and 5<br />
then sum = sum - x</p>
<p>Or we could just solve it with an else</p>
<p>if x is a multiple of 3 then sum = sum + xM<br />
else if x is a multiple of 3 then sum = sum + x</p>
<p>Now a lot of people will understand that the &quot;trick&quot; is not really tricky in this case. Remember not to count multiples of 3 and 5 twice is pretty simple. But the curve is pretty steep - after 20 or 30 questions, it's much more hidden.</p>
<p>And that's the gist of what I'm saying tonight.</p>
<p>By the way, here's that pseudocode in python:</p>
<p>f=0<br />
x=1<br />
while x &lt; 1000:<br />
    if x%3==0:<br />
        f=f+x<br />
    elif x%5==0:<br />
        f=f+x<br />
    x=x+1<br />
print f</p>
