<p>I had a question from a coworker the other day and it became obvious to me that they did not really understand what the word <em>Cascading</em> meant in the phrase <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>.</p>
<p>Let me 'splain.</p>
<p>No, no. There is too much. Let me sum up.</p>
<p>From the OED defines a Cascade thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. A waterfall. a. Usually, a small waterfall; esp. one of a series of small falls, formed by water in its descent over rocks, or in the artificial works of the kind introduced in landscape gardening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, that might not be particularly helpful, but if you really look at that definition, you'll find that it explains things perfectly. Specifically, I'd like you to think of a series of small falls, and how the first fall <em>cascades</em> over the rest of the falls, and how the falls lower down redirect the water from higher up.</p>
<p>See? It's not a bad analogy.</p>
<p>What happens with CSS is that each definition (or <em>rock</em> in the analogy) directs a particular tag, class, or id (or <em>water</em> in the analogy) to a specific end point. The definitions higher up in the list take effect first, and the definitions lower down in the list take effect after. In a <em>cascade</em> you might say.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>&lt;-- The HTML Code --&gt;</p>
<div id="special" class="interesting">
  <p>Some content</p>
</div>
<p>/* The CSS */
div.special {
color:#ffffff;
background-color:#000000;
}
div#interesting {
color:#ffff00;
background-color:#0000ff;
}</p>
<p>Whatever comes lower in the cascade (the last <em>rock</em> as it were - in this case div#interesting) defines where that bit of water (the div) ends up going. In this case, it's going to be remarkably ugly because #ffff00; and #0000ff; aren't good colour choices, but I think the point is made, and that is this:</p>
<p>Cascading is important - if you're going to be a web developer, I'd suggest learning it.</p>
