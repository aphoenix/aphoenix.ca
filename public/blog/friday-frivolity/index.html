<p>For anyone who was waiting with baited breath for my latest edition of 5✭ Fridays, I apologize. It will likely be posted on Tuesday now. I'm still having some music player issues.</p>
<p>For those keeping score, we've got iTunes solidly scrapped and uninstalled (I still use it on my Mac, but mostly to play CDs). WinAmp is running a strong game, but the rating thing isn't as intuitive as I'd like it to be. I'm working on that. Right now, with an ever-so-slight lead is the dark horse; Windows Media Player. However, right now I'm barely listening to my own music library, because I've been enjoying <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>.</p>
<p>For those who do not know, Pandora is a customizable internet &quot;radio station&quot;. It's not really radio - what happens is that you pick a couple of songs / artists that you like and use them as &quot;feeders&quot; for your station. For instance, I have a <strong>Dark / Prog / Metal</strong> station which I fed with <em>Tool</em> and <em>Rage Against the Machine</em> for artists and a couple of songs by other hard rock artists that I particularly enjoy. Once given this feed information, Pandora will play a song to establish that it's in the right sort of genre, and then it will start to suggest other music, which you can give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to. The idea is that it will &quot;learn&quot; what sort of music you want in your station and will play songs that you enjoy. Also, if you give a song a thumb-down, it will skip the song and not play it on that station anymore. I have, in addition to the aforementioned <strong>Dark / Prog / Metal</strong> station, three more:</p>
<p><strong>Alternarock</strong> based on <em>Nirvana</em>, <em>Audioslave</em>, <em>Thornley</em>, <em>Pearl Jam</em> and <em>The Tea Party</em>, to scratch the alternative rock itch that I grew up trying to scratch. <strong>Electric Blues and Awesome Shredders</strong> based on a number of musicians including <em>B.B. King</em>, <em>Jimi Hendrix</em> and <em>Stevie Ray Vaughan</em> because you can't have enough awesome guitar. <strong>A bit o' CanCon</strong> which is fed with ten Canadian bands, across a number of genres. That one's more experimental than anything else.</p>
<p>If you're interested in starting up with Pandora, it's free (as in beer, not speech), and entertaining. If you don't want to sign up, I think you can just listen to my radio stations at <a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/andrew.phoenix">my Pandora profile</a>. I thoroughly recommend all the channels except the last one - I'll have to spend some time listening to it to tune it up.</p>
