<p>One of my favourite blogs to read is <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray's Ongoing</a> - and this is a funny lead in 
to my first music post, because Tim is very much a technophile (for instance, he was recently <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/151">featured on the cover of 
Linux Journal</a>, and on the inside too!). One of my favourite recurring themes is 
his &quot;5✭♫&quot; posts, in which he expounds on various musics that he listens to.</p>
<p>If the title looks broken, you should <a href="http://tools.google.com/firefox/toolbar/bundle/">Get Firefox</a>. It's the simplest 
way to fix it.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of thievery Open Source Ideas, I'm going to implement something similar. Right now it's called &quot;5✭ 
Fridays&quot; and I'm going to tell you a bit about what I'm listening to... and at this moment it's the Misfits (warning: 
the Misfits may be offensive).</p>
<p><img src="/images/rock/TheMisfits.jpg" alt="A Logo for the Misfits" /></p>
<p>The Misfits are a great punk band. I'll tell you right now that, even though I'm <em>in</em> a punk band, it's not a genre of 
music that I listen to regularly. Punk's great, but I tend to want a bit more, um, <em>music</em> in my music. There's often a 
wall of sound and some yelling, and lots of double kick drum riffs, and a bass player that rakes the strings constantly, 
and it gets old quick. Also, even though I have a lot of rage, it's mostly a quiet, vitriolic, smoldering rage that 
lends itself more to Metal or Franz Liszt. I'm not &quot;anti-establishment&quot; either; the man's not keeping me down and I 
don't have a yearning for anarchy. The Misfits carve right through all the problems that I have by using angry but 
harmonic guitars and establishing strong melodic vocals singing B-movie themed lyrics that are as apt to make you laugh 
as to incite anger in you. Here's &quot;Resurrection&quot; (beware the mild sacrilege)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complications inside of me reminds me that my heart won't always 
beat The ugly face of death that's smiling at my rotting teeth</p>
<p>I will die here in this sorrow 
I was waiting for tomorrow 
Palpitate the pulse until you 
feel 
my 
heart explode against the wall</p>
<p>Talk about me, Laugh about me cry about me... nail me to the cross 
I'll be a martyr for the hated, the weak, the ugly, the lost</p>
<p>I will die here in this sorrow 
I won't wait for tomorrow 
Palpitate the pulse until you 
resurrect 
my 
soul from the wall</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zombie much? To go with this, they have an astoundingly catchy melody and a powerful guitar riff, which is one of the 
most used chord progressions in history - but it works. It's got a beat that's hard to, well, beat, and it gets my head 
bobbing along every time I hear the song.</p>
<p>The Misfits have this tendency to eschew writing lots of lyrics, which may be a biproduct of the fact that their songs 
tend to be under two minutes in length. &quot;Resurrection&quot; runs 1:29 and goes all-out for the duration. Another Misfits song 
that is amongst my favourites is &quot;The Haunting&quot; which clocks in at 1:27 and is basically a 40 second song with a repeat. 
It's not a complicated song, but they're not a complicated band, and sometimes it's not about complication; the gestalt 
is more than the sum of its parts. There are only five chords in &quot;The Haunting&quot;, but they're the <em>right</em> five chords, 
and they're supported by the powerful melody and the intense energy.</p>
<p>If you are interested in trying punk out for a spin, but want less noise and more melody, as many people often do, you 
would be hardpressed to find a better package than the Misfits. Besides, if you don't like them, the song will be done 
in just a minute.</p>
