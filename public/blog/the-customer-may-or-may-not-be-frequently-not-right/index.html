<p>I just read <a href="http://positivesharing.com/2008/03/top-5-reasons-why-the-customer-is-always-right-is-wrong/">The Top 5 Reasons Why the Customer is Always Right is Wrong</a> and it's interesting, but there's a whole part of customer interaction that they have kind of skipped over, and I think it's important. I'm going to add my #6, which is really just more on #5.</p>
<p>The Customer is Frequently Not Right.</p>
<p>It's kind of a simple thing to say, and it directly contradicts that saying that we're all familiar with and mostly don't like, but it's a simple truth that we all know, deep down. Because Customers are People and People are frequently wrong. I know. I'm a person. I'm wrong a lot. Like the other day, I was playing a game with my family and I misinterpreted one of the rules. We read as a group and clarified. Or another time when I decided that I would try something called Sushi Pizza - I figured that two things I loved would be great when combined. Wrong. Or this other time when I thought that the cold that I had wasn't anything major, but I went to the doctor and she told me that I was really sick.</p>
<p>That last one is the one I want to focus on.</p>
<p>In that particular situation, I was a the Customer and the Doctor was the Contractor / Employee (I'll stick with Contractor for the purpose of saving myself typing time). I, the Customer, did not really know how to deal with a particular problem so I went to someone else who did - I Contracted that person, in fact, to help me out. I thought that I had a minor cold, and the doctor didn't and gave me a bunch of medication. I, the Customer, was wrong. &quot;But,&quot; you might say, &quot;that's not a generalize-able situation! The doctor has a specialized service / knowledge!&quot; That is the case about any producer / consumer, contractor / client, employee / customer relationship, though, and it's an important thing to think about. You go to a producer / contractor / employee to get a particular good or service that you either decline to or cannot provide for yourself. In most cases, it is &quot;cannot&quot;; the customer is not able to provide for themselves the particular thing that they require.</p>
<p>Here is where I am frequently puzzled - if the customer does not have the ability to create the good or perform the service, why are they likely correct about it? The producer / contractor / employee is the one who knows more about their particular product. And if they're good at what they'll do, they'll share the knowledge with the customer.</p>
<p>A part of good customer service is trying to find the points at which the customer is <em>not</em> right and to correct them. My doctor, for instance, corrected my assumption that I had a cold. A good lingerie salesperson would point out that their customer is wearing the incorrect bra size. A good web developer might tell you, &quot;No, we're not going to put all the styles in-line&quot;. And after all of these mistakes are pointed out, they will come up with the <em>right</em> solution and you should listen to them. You should listen because, if they're successful, they know more about what they're doing than you do, and a large part of what you are paying for is the knowledge that they have accrued over the time that person has spent in their chosen vocation.</p>
<p>The customer is frequently wrong. That's why they're the customer.</p>
