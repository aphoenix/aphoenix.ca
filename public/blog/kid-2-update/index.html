<p>Well, I haven't actually written anything down about the fact that I am now the father of two awesome girls (no longer just one). Kid2 was born Feb 8, and it's been awesome having a tiny kid around the house, though it has, at times, been a challenge. We're lucky with respect to the sleep thing; she sleeps like a champ. We're also lucky to have an older daughter who is doing an amazing job as a big sister. Kid1 is fantastically caring and awesome and does her best to make sure her little sister has everything she needs.</p>
<p>Kid1 has started to display her proclivity for science. Her favourite activity of an evening is to figure out, set up, hypothesize about and complete a science experiment. For example, the other day, we set out two little basins of water with food colouring in them, then put a paper towel between them to show how capillary action works. We did the same with a piece of standard white paper, after trying to guess if standard paper would go faster or slower than paper towel. That experiment is still going; it is making some fantastic blue / purple / red art in excruciatingly slow fashion.</p>
<p>Kid2 is a baby and does standard baby stuff. It's hard to drum up a whole paragraph about her.</p>
<p>Kid1 is also deeply into fantasy books right now. We have completely <em>The Hobbit</em> and have started <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, both of which she loves. My wife just finished reading the first <em>Harry Potter</em> book to her; witches, wizards, ents and elves, orcs and hobbits and magic! There's never enough to satisfy. I read LOTR for 45 minutes out loud tonight (including the songs, which she tries to get me to sing) and she was begging for more when I was done. Oh, and just the other day, she came home and very seriously said, &quot;Dad. Some time soon, can we watch Star Wars together?&quot;</p>
<p>Being a Geek Dad is amazing.</p>
