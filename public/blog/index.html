    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I didn't have any particular plans for this week, as I had met my goal by week 3. I didn't play as much and I revisited
one of the games that I had played in Week 3 - Truberbrook - to make some more progress. Guild of Dungeoneering and 
Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut both get mini-reviews.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I've thought more on the games since my edits to last week's threads. This last week was a bit rough, and I spent more 
time in the evening playing video games than I should have. As a result, I have made it through my April goal, which was 
to play one game from each of the last 12 months of Humble Monthly Bundles. This was one of the best weeks - Evergarden,
Soul Calibur VI, Truberbrook, and a couple of others.</p>

    <p>A week into backlog burner and chill and I have made a lot of progress towards the goal of trying out a bunch of games
that were not on my radar at all before now. This is shaping up to be a fun event, and I will be trying to do more of 
these community created events. Surviving Mars, God's Trigger, Sonic Mania, Bad North are all up!</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>At <a href="https://tildes.net">Tildes</a> there's an event going on called the
<a href="https://tildes.net/%7Egames/neh/tildes_backlog_burner_event_shrink_your_unplayed_games_list_this_april">Game Backlog Burner</a>
and I have decided to take part in it. Here's the
idea in brief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that many of us will be stuck at home for this month, I know that many of us could likely use something to pull
our attention away from the news, and I know that many of us have accumulated quite the to-play list of games. <strong>As
such, I'm thinking it could be fun for us to tackle those lists together and collectively clean up our clutter! Let's
all burn through our backlogs!</strong></p>

    <p>The other day, there was a post on <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> that asked <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uxuww/are_there_any_songs_which_you_are_embarrassed_to/">Are there any songs which you are embarrassed to like?</a> There are some great answers; I took the top 80 plus the original poster's and <a href="http://grooveshark.com/playlist/Reddit+s+Embarrassment/74446204">compiled a list</a>. Here are my mini-reviews of the songs.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>There are a number of HTML tags which are commonly misunderstood and misused. I've done it myself, with some frequency 
over the years. I've argued that some of these are deprecated, when they weren't. And now I've come full circle, and I 
had a full on argument with someone over the use of the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag recently, and I wanted to talk about four specific and 
oft misused tags: <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>This post is not about taxes.</p>
<p>There are a few key concepts that people rely on with a user interface and one of them is consistency. Consistency is one of the most important parts of a UI, and trumps practically any other; we want things to behave in a way that we are used to. This makes it easier for us to use things. Doors, for instance, have the same general UI in most cases; there is a handle, some hinges, and a big solid part that …

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>In a nutshell, here's the problem with posting a link to something you strenuously disagree with using social media. It's all the success metric. When you link to something, you're basically giving it your vote of approval. If the thing that you are linking to is bad, harmful or stupid, then you need to find a way to remove that vote of approval. The easiest way to do this is to find an actual website that you can link to from your social medi…

    <p>Forgive the title, but I've been looking through my stats and have found some interesting things and made some decisions about design moving forward.</p>
<p>First up, screen resolution. Over 85% of people accessing my site did so at a resolution at or exceeding a width of 1280px. That's a change from even a year ago, when only about 65% of people ran at that resolution. It's nice to see upgrades happening.</p>
<p>Next, browsers. IE comes in ro…
