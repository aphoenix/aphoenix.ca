<p>We have often heard the old saw, &quot;<em>A picture is worth a thousand words.</em>&quot; Is that really true? Here are a few points to consider.</p>
<p>We see at about 22 - 24 fps. Each individual frame that we see can be considered to be a picture. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then we're taking in 22,000 to 24,000 words per second.</p>
<ul>
<li>A movie is something you watch, and almost flawless (for the purpose of being seen, not from any artistic point of view).</li>
<li>A movie is usually about 100 minutes (or so) long.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, a moving picture is worth about 22 to 24 thousand words per second. A full length <em>motion picture</em> or movie is worth between 132 and 144 million words.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, &quot;Moby Dick&quot; had about 208,000 words. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is about 645,000 words.</p>
<p>So, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; would be worth about 10 minutes worth of a movie, using this formula.</p>
<p>I think that's a little bogus. Let's look at it this way:</p>
<p>&quot;Moby Dick&quot; would be a pretty decent 2.5 hour movie (150 minutes). (<em>Editor's Note - I realize that there are a few Moby Dick movies - 22, 77, 116 and 180 minute versions. If I was making it, I would aim for 2.5 hours. That's what I meant. Plus, if I picked a different time, then it wouldn't prove my point!</em>) That's about 1385 words per minute, or approximately 23 words per second. Funny thing - didn't we say that a moving picture has 22 to 24 frames per second?</p>
<p>So, apparently, a picture is worth one word.</p>
<p><strong>QED</strong><br />
(<em>Editor's Note: <strong>QED</strong> is an acronym that one puts at the end of a math problem. It stands for Pancho Villa saying, &quot;Questeeon Ees Done.&quot; I considered posting this in a new category called &quot;Lunacy&quot; or possibly &quot;Frivolity.&quot;</em>)</p>
