<p>I came to the sad realization the other day that in the 10-odd years since high school, I have gained a significant amount of weight. More importantly, this winter I stopped feeling like I was really all that healthy or active. Even more importantly, I tried on my kilt on the weekend and (*sob*) it did not fit. By about 4 inches. And I've lost about 18 pounds since Christmas.</p>
<p>I have decided that I am going to try to reverse this process with the following plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will begin to exercise more regularly</li>
<li>I will change my eating habits</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is a very simple thing that one usually attempts to do when one decides to lose weight. <em>But!</em> I have a plan to entice myself to go through with it. The secondary plan is this: <em>I will blog about my (possibly mis-)adventures in body alteration!</em> For the record, I'm not going in for &quot;weight loss&quot; though that is likely what will happen. I'm going in for &quot;being more healthy&quot;. Thus, I am going to add a few new categories to the blog: &quot;Exercise&quot; and &quot;Intake&quot; (under the heading &quot;Wellness&quot;) which will not appear in the normal flow of updates, but will be checkable to all the world if they click on them.</p>
