    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/5-fridays-jorge-miguel/">5✭ Fridays - Jorge Miguel</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>My introduction to Jorge Miguel was low key. I was in my office, trying to figure out a particular bug that I was 
experiencing, and a friend dropped by, slightly breathless, and said, &quot;Come with me right now!&quot; I hopped up and went 
with him, with no explanation, and had a problem keeping up. He exited the building and walked into the building right 
across from it. In the foyer, there was Jorge Miguel with a dancer to accompany him, playing an acoustic flamenco guitar
to a group of about 30 staff and students.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>

    <p>All right, I'm working on getting comments working. I think I'll be able to do it over lunch time today.</p>
<p>I may add a blogroll as well.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/windows-necessities/">Windows Necessities</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>First off, a general disclaimer and a brief history: of the three OSes I use on a regular basis (Windows, Linux and Mac OS), I started with Windows. Specifically, I started on an IBM Aptiva with Windows 95 (which still runs very well and has never, ever needed to be reinstalled), moved on to a Toshiba Tecra laptop with Windows 98 (which still runs, albeit poorly, after one reinstall), skipped over Windows 2000 (being mostly interested in spend…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I guess I could also have labelled this as &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; or &quot;Why MySpace is Rotten.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously my point of view is clear at the outset - MySpace is bad. As a disclaimer, I'm not averse to new things - in fact, one might say that I'm addicted to new things - and I do not automatically dislike things that are popular. I apprehensively love Google, for instance, and I am currently a Facebooker (though Fac…

    <p>Of note - I just upgraded from Wordpress 2.0.something to 2.1, so there may be some interesting changes to the blog. I have not yet noticed any problems, but I'll report on them here.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/5-fridays-the-misfits/">5✭ Fridays - The Misfits</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>One of my favourite blogs to read is <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray's Ongoing</a> - and this is a funny lead in 
to my first music post, because Tim is very much a technophile (for instance, he was recently <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/151">featured on the cover of 
Linux Journal</a>, and on the inside too!). One of my favourite recurring themes is 
his &quot;5✭♫&quot; posts, in which he expounds on various musics that he listens to.</p>
<p>If the title looks broken, you should <a href="http://tools.google.com/firefox/toolbar/bundle/">Get Firefox</a>. It's the simplest 
way to fix it.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> is an invaluable tool for developers that don't have a budget for proprietary software. You can find a lot of useful bits and pieces there, not to mention wholes and entires, that are incredibly useful for whatever your software needs are. As a staunch supporter of OSS, I'd say I was a fan.</p>
<p>Well, until today. Today we find the wrench in the works.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>As you may or may not have noticed, I've overhauled aphoenix.ca. This used to be a fairly static website with a few extra odds and ends (like the photoblog) available to peruse. The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Monday is &quot;Left Brain&quot; day and you'll probably have something fairly technical to see here. Friday is &quot;Right Brain&quot; day and you'll find a post that is fairly music oriented. Wednesday and Weekend days are photoblog day…

    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/my-firefox-extensions/">My Firefox Extensions</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>One thing that interests me among the techgnoscenti is who installs which Firefox extension and why they do so. Firefox is a great browser out of the box, but once you start adding on your extensions, it really becomes all about <em>you</em>. If you think it's beyond you to install an extension, let me tell you - you're absolutely wrong. If you can get here to this site, you can certainly customize your firefox. Just mozy on over to <a href="h…

    <p>The topic of brain lateralization has already been <a href="http://www.aphoenix.ca/right-brain-19/">discussed in some detail</a>, but the previous article left out the Left Brain. Let's just pretend this article had all the same verve and panache of the previous article, but ended with a bit about Left Brain functions, specifically about Techgnostics (knowledge of technology) and The Proof (wherein I give highly spurious &quot;proofs&quot; by …
