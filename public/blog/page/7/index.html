    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>Well, we have moved into the house. For the most part, things are great - I still need to bring a whole bunch of my stuff from the apartment to the house (mostly books) and we need to really start <em>unpacking</em>. The entire living room is just <em>full</em> of stuff. It is amazing how many <em>things</em> one person (or in this case, three) can acquire. The house project status stands thusly:</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>One of the things that I always find important when designing a website is to get rid of as many of the browser specific presets that each browser has as a default style. Think of the page as a whole as a nation and the tags as the individuals - we really should put the layout of the page <em>as a whole</em> above layout of <em>individuals</em>. And think of yourself as a little tinpot dictator that has complete and utter control over each and…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I came across an interesting article, titled <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/trends/n_9437/">The Porn Myth</a> by Naomi Wolf. I can summarize it for you - they Myth is that pornography turns men into sex-crazed psychos, willing to rape and pillage to get what they want, which is sex, sex, sex. The actuality, according to Wolf is that men have becoming uninterested in women because women do not compare with the <em>ideal porn woman</em>.…

    <p>Well, it's been a while since I bought the Rebel XTi, and I thought I'd post a brief review. I've got a few other cameras that I'm comparing it too - a Canon 30D, a Fuji Finepix S3000 and S9000, a Canon Powershot A80 and A740 (those are all the cameras that I'm moderately to seriously familiar with). Since I'm not a professional photographer, I'll be talking about a few things that matter to me. I certainly won't be comparing every aspect acro…

    <p>Well, I've gone and done it. I've bought a house. And, of course, the first thing one has to do when one buys a house is to rip out a large portion of the crappy work that someone else has done and put good work back into it.</p>
<p>All I have to say is this: I'm very lucky my father is a contractor.</p>
<p>We pulled out all of the upstairs washroom on the weekend (we took possession on Friday) including all the fixtures, most of the walls, in…

    <p>I had the luck to catch the Austria - USA U-20 FIFA Soccer quarterfinal game on Saturday, and let me tell you, it was a doozy.</p>
<p>For the entire first half of regulation, I thought the United States was going to win. They showed a remarkable drive that was let down only by their inability to finish plays. Almost all of the action was in Austria's half, where I was sitting. The Americans had some of the best footwork I have ever seen in soc…

    <p>I had a thought, which I'm finding difficult to complete. It goes something like this.</p>
<p>My partner's father is not very good with computers. I don't think he really gets them, so he often will ask my partner for help with the computer. Now, my partner's no whiz-kid with computers, so whenever she has a crazy problem she'll ask me to fix it. I'm pretty good with computers - I work with them all day every day. However, when I can't answer …

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I went to see Transformers on Wednesday night. Yes, that's right. Opening night. If there's one thing I hate about movies in the theatre, it's seeing them on opening night. You're right in there with the unwashed masses (read: teenagers) that don't seem to <em>get</em> movies at the same level that I do. You're right, I'm being pretentious. It's on purpose, and it's mildly sarcastic. Mildly, because it's mostly true. (kidding!)</p>
