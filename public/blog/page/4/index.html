<p>Go ahead, read that article. I'll wait.</p>
<p>If you want the TLDR; version, in Ottawa when a team gets ahead by more than 5 goals in a game, they are declared the loser of the game. So here is the immediate take home message:</p>

    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/riding-a-bike/">Riding a Bike</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I've recently entered into a conversation with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ccarmichael">Mr. Carmichael</a> about bike lanes, sidewalks and roads and where bikes should be. In it, I defended the idea that bikes should be allowed to ride on the sidewalk, but things were confused because of Twitter's 140 character limit. I came across sounding like I completely disapproved of bike lanes, which I don't.</p>
<p>Succinctly:</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>The more that I use twitter, the harder I find it to actually write in my blog. Why would I spend time making lovingly crafted sentences, when I could explain myself in 140 characters, or even less?</p>
<p>I find it increasingly difficult to both write and respond to emails in more than one line.</p>
<p>I like texting on my phone more and more.</p>
<p>I feel like social media is starting my brain oozing out of my ears. I have to make more of a…

    <p>I'd forgotten that these posts get automatically sucked into my facebook page. My brother-in-law mentioned that I was making non-sensical posts about Font Faces at a party last night, and was wondering if I'd had more than just my Warcraft account hacked recently.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://aphoenix.ca/blog/font-face/">@font-face</a></h3>
    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I am on the fence with @font-face. I've noticed more and more (after it was pointed out to me by <a href="http://www.sinnick.com">Nick</a>) that when you use @font-face, the text displays and then will, after a brief pause, morph into the selected font. Every time I see that happen, I want to use @font-face slightly less.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the web would be so much prettier if I could just add &quot;@font-face: Aller&quot; to every page…

<p>I've been trying to hone my Python skills, so I <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org">Dove Into Python</a> with a vengeance.

<li>What's in your RSS reader?</li>

    <p>I had quite the discussion with <a href="http://www.christopher-parsons.com/blog/">Chris</a> the other day via twitter about pros and cons of Vancouver 2010. He had some great points.</p>
<p>The security of the Olympics leaves much to be desired. There's been some free speech issues. There has been a huge increase in the amount of security present in Vancouver. Both of these are valid and important concerns, <em>but</em> I think that it is bei…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>There's a lot of anti-olympic sentiment floating around these days. No2010 seems to be a pretty popular tag on twitter, and the website itself seems to get a fair amount of traffic (you'll have to google it - they're getting no traffic from me). I'm definitely pro-olympics, and also pro-canadian olympics, so I thought I'd try to educate myself on why people are actually against Canada acting as a host nation for the Olympics. To summarize from…
