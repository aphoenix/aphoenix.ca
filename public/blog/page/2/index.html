    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I am a Toronto Maple Leafs fan.</p>
<p>There, I said it. I put it out there. The Leafs, they are my team. My jersey is a blue one. Every year, I hold on to the faint glimmer of hope that my team will make it into the playoffs. Not that they'll win; just that they'll get into the playoffs. That's life as a Leafs fan.</p>
<p>However, they're not my actual favourite team. Like most everyone else in the Leafs nation, I am mildly ashamed to say &qu…

    <p>Hello all! I got an interesting email from one **[redacted]**Â about my my photo <a href="/sunny-skies-10/">Sunny Skies</a>. Here is the email, with Trevor's email taken out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe we have been in contact before. My picture, &quot;Sunny Skies&quot; is still up on your website. I would appreciate this being taken down, or at least some credit given. The reason I am ticked off about this is because that everyone on your c…

<p>I do remember taking a picture similar a while back. While it was similar, you are right that it might not have been the same one. Sorry about that. I'll try to dig up my picture for conformation.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>The past weekend, I was fortunate enough to get involved in a project called <a href="http://www.thatsundemocratic.ca">That's Undemocratic</a>, which is a tongue-in-cheek political satire site. My good friend <a href="http://eclecti.ca">Sean</a> had the idea to use a popular style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a> featuring a focal picture, with two text areas, in an effort to remove the efficacy of the words &quot;That's…

    <p><em>This is a blog post that I started in around 2008. I'm going to post it, and then hopefully follow up with my more current thoughts on Social networking.</em></p>
<p>Social Networking. That's one of those buzzwords that I almost cringe when I hear.</p>
<p>There is a gap in Social Networking, and it's right in the middle. When you fall through it, you start to think of Facebook as an <em>end point</em> instead of a starting point. You think…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>Well, I haven't actually written anything down about the fact that I am now the father of two awesome girls (no longer just one). Kid2 was born Feb 8, and it's been awesome having a tiny kid around the house, though it has, at times, been a challenge. We're lucky with respect to the sleep thing; she sleeps like a champ. We're also lucky to have an older daughter who is doing an amazing job as a big sister. Kid1 is fantastically caring and awes…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>That's a bit of a sensationalist title, but it's also not too far off of true.</p>
<p>I was recently working on a problem for <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> that starts off like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:</p>
<p>0.123456789101112131415161718192021...</p>

<p>The constructed number is made in such a way that you count from n to i…
