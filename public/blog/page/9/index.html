    <p>Not words you want to read while trying to start Firefox.</p>
<p>So, I'm currently an Opera-only sort of guy until my Firefox woes are fixed. I've always kind of liked Opera - it's the hot-but-vapid-blonde of web browsers. It's really pretty, but it's actually quite lacking in substance.</p>
<p>Entertainingly, during the course of writing the previous paragraph, I was able to fix the segfault core dump issue by going into safe mode and removin…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>The story of the cycling continues.</p>
<p>I've been out three times since the last update - once on a go around my original route, once just to the grocery store and back and once on a short pavement-only trip around the neighbourhood. The off road experience has been a little difficult of late because of all the rain - I have a lot of caked on mud on my bike right now and I got stuck once, though I (obviously) managed to get out.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>Last night when I got home I went on another fairly short bike ride with a different path.</p>
<p>![](/images/cycle/path2.gif alt=)</p>
<p>This one is about 2 km by my estimation.</p>
<p>Last night I was tired so I punked out and only did 40 crunches and 10 pushups. This morning I planned to take Path #1 again, but with the wind chill factor, it was about -8°C, which was just too cold. So I did 50 crunches and 20 pushups before a quick shower …

    <p>Over the last 24 hours, I have had lunch, dinner and am about to have breakfast.</p>
<p>Lunch: Went to turtle jack's and had a peppercorn burger with sauteed mushrooms with a side salad. See? Salad. An attempt at faux-healthiness. Or something. Oh, and a pint of Rickard's Red.</p>
<p>Dinner: Spicy beef curry with naan bread. I made the curry and it was just a tad <em>too</em> spicy for my liking (which should tell you something). It consisted …

    <p>I think I'm off to a good start. Last night I rode the bike for a while. Here's the route:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cycle/path1.gif" alt="the bicycle path I'm taking" /></p>
<p>It's not very long, but it's pretty decent - got some little uphills and downhills, some cycling on road and off (one fairly intrepit bit across the back of Zehrs to the west end community centre), and it's mostly a sprint. It's about 2.5 - 3 km by my estimation and I s…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I came to the sad realization the other day that in the 10-odd years since high school, I have gained a significant amount of weight. More importantly, this winter I stopped feeling like I was really all that healthy or active. Even more importantly, I tried on my kilt on the weekend and (*sob*) it did not fit. By about 4 inches. And I've lost about 18 pounds since Christmas.</p>
<p>I have decided that I am going to try to reverse this process…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I was exceptionally hungry this morning, so I partook of the standard bullring breakfast #1, which is an egg sandwich with bacon, cheese and tomato. I also had a large double-double coffee. All told, not particularly healthy, but I'm not planning on feeling guilty over it.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, standard bullring breakfast #2 is a bowl of instant Quaker Oatmeal and a large double-double coffee. Yes, I loves me my coffees.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>It's been a while since I've been able to write about music for a variety of reasons. First there's the whole music 
player scandal, which is still bothering me quite a bit. There are no clear winners thus far, only clear losers. The 
only thing that's keeping me going is Pandora, but it's got a bit of a problem in that I can't just select whatever song
I'm jonesing to hear. So, once again, no music from my library. Problem the second: I've had the plague. It wasn't too 
bad - sore throat, coughing, boils, rain of toads and the like - but I've been spending most of my time abed and not 
listening to music or thinking about writing. When I got back from being sick, my time was spent equally between 
catching up on 150 email messages and being excited about being able to go see (and open for) the Creepshow.</p>

    <p>I'm not even sure I have the right competitors up there; I'm talking about AMD / Athlon vs Intel / Core 2 Duo, or some combination thereof. I just got a brand spanking new AMD 64 computer for work and I have been having a heck of a time getting Ubuntu to install on it. Right now I have Dapper Drake (for those not in the know, not the newest version of Ubuntu) installed, and I had to install <em>that</em> using the i386 version <em>and</em> net…

    <p>I used the term &quot;baited breath&quot; yesterday, which brings to mind a poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sally, having swallowed cheese, Directs down holes the scented breeze, Enticing thus with baited breath Nice mice to an untimely death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baited breath is a silly idea - what does one bait one's breath with? (Evidently cheese if one is a mousehunter). Why do we say this?</p>
<p>Well, to start with, the word is all wrong. It …
