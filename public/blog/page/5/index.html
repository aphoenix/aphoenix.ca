    <p><a href="http://kylemackie.wordpress.com">Kyle</a>, <a href="http://dawnwentzell.com/">Dawn</a> and <a href="http://pileofsticks.com/">certain others</a> were having a bit of discussion on the delivery of milk to people's houses in Ontario. The discussion basically centred around milk bags vs. glass milk jugs, but included discussions on &quot;organic&quot;. It was interesting how dichotomous this discussion was.</p>

    <p>I kid, I kid. But there's a lot of talk about the iPad in the last few days, and I'm trying to keep an open mind because there are people I respect that seem to think it's great. But I don't get it.</p>
<p>The most cogent argument was from <a href="http://doughorne.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/the-ipad-ive-had-a-vision/">Doug, who had a vision</a>. It's true - Apple won't be comparing themselves to the computers that you already have. They won't b…

    <p>I don't want to talk about abortion. I want to talk about hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Dr. George Tiller, a doctor who performed abortions, was <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/31/tiller-abortion.html">shot to death in church</a> today.

    <p>I, along with many other people in Canada, have been following along on the Tori Stafford case and were distressed at the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/05/21/stafford-search-police021.html">grisly conclusion (cbc article)</a> that, for me, hits very close to home. They are currently looking for the poor little girl's body very close to where I live, and even closer to where I grew up and it makes me sick to think that something …

    <p>Begins tonight. I'm not sure how long it is going to take me, but it's not an insignificant task. I think I've learned something - don't assume that your blog posts are going to have the same format forever!</p>
<p>Photos will likely not be working for a while, and I think I'm going to change categories into tags. Even though, at some level, for some reason, I don't like tags.</p>
<p>Grr. Tags.</p>

    <p>I've always been a bit of a duffer when it came to photoshop or other such <a href="http://www.gimp.org">image manipulation programs</a>; I can work with pre-existing photos no problem - I can isolate images and put them together and do lots of the nifty photoshop tricks, like airbrushing people to get rid of blemishes, or reducing red-eye, or moving them slightly in a picture, or adding someone in or taking someone out, etc. etc. However, I'v…

    <p>A new theme for the website is basically exactly the thing to get over my hiatus from blogging. The new theme is a single column layout, and I'm torn between emphasizing photos and emphasizing blog entries. Both are displaying well, but I'm not sure which one should come first. Any preferences?</p>
<p>I'm also working on a nifty little widget to let you select which stylesheet design you want to display in your browser. I'm retooling the HTML …
