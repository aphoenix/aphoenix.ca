    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>Wait, that is a misleading or possibly even <em>ironic</em> title for this post, since I do not have a UPS. The fallout from this, unfortunately, is the complete pooching of my work desktop. I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, near the end of the day, I made a grievous error. I decided to upgrade my system from Ubuntu 6.10 to 7.04. There had been a couple of brown-outs over the course of the day, but I didn't think…

    <p>Well, I changed up how aphoenix.ca is looking. I'm moderately happy with the overall effect, though I reserve the right to revert to the old look at any time. I'm already cooking up a scheme for the next look and I'm getting ready to start posting in my photoblog again (the photos are now going to be integrated into this part of the blog). On the topic of the photoblog - I just bought a new camera. It's a <a href="http://canon.ca/english/index…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>Yesterday I got an email from Tim Westergen, the Founder of <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora.com</a>. I am now mildly upset, because Pandora has started filtering by IP addresses so that people outside of the United States are unable to listen to their service. Previously, they filtered by asking your Zip Code (which I'm sure everyone outside of the US entered as &quot;90210&quot;), but they've beefed up their security, I guess. The le…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>We have often heard the old saw, &quot;<em>A picture is worth a thousand words.</em>&quot; Is that really true? Here are a few points to consider.</p>
<p>We see at about 22 - 24 fps. Each individual frame that we see can be considered to be a picture. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then we're taking in 22,000 to 24,000 words per second.</p>

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>This blog is quickly falling by the wayside because of life. There's a number of updates and upgrades I want to make to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete overhaul to the theme - let's face it, this isn't the most visually stunning blog in the world. I did this CSS as an interesting exercise to make a 2-column extremely liquid layout. Test it out - change the text size, and the pagination all remains the same. Whoop-de-doo. I'm likely going to stay wit…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>So a while ago, I leaped into Ubuntu, and I haven't really looked back very much. I mean - sure, I use Windows™ to play games, inasmuch as I play games anymore, and I've used Media Center™ a bit, but not very much. At work, I've been using Ubuntu Edgy Eft almost exclusively (with a mind to update to Feisty Fawn soon), but I find that I need to do more and more testing in a Windows™ environment. On my laptop, I dual boot, but as my laptop is my…

    <p>Every mean thing I've ever wanted to say about Pachelbel's Canon in D is said much better in this YouTube clip from Rob Paravonian.</p>
<p>The Video formerly found here, is still available from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/JdxkVQy7QLM">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>I would happily write more, but Paravonian says everything worth saying. Of note: I have made several of these jokes before but I was never able to string them all together like this guy…

    <p>That's right folks - a little bit of road hockey action happened this afternoon at work. It was a good time, but it really highlighted the fact that I have a goodly way to go before I'm in good shape.</p>
<p>We started out with 7 players, and had an occasional floating 8th that changed. I began on the team of 3, and we were rather outmatched from the get go. I have come to the stunning conclusion that I will never be a goalie, because I am abs…

    <span>•</span>
    
    <p>I've been asked a few times why I have both a rÃ©sumÃ© and a CV when they're the same thing. Now, before I explain my reasoning, let me say this: I don't think that I'm necessarily correct and that the people who asked are incorrect. I merely would like to share my opinion and why I do things the way that I do.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're looking for someone to do web work for you, feel free to browse through my <a href="/resume/cv.html">Curricul…

    <p>I feel happy! I wanna go for a walk! I feel fine!</p>
<p>/Python reference</p>
<p>So I've not been feeling 100% for the last week, and I haven't reported on my comings and goings for a while. There have been many kilometres cycled, a few jogged, some walked. I've done close to 500 crunches and 200 pushups since the last update, plus some very light weight training. Progress is being made - a couple of people have commented on how I seem to be …
