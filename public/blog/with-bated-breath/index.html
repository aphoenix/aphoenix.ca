<p>I used the term &quot;baited breath&quot; yesterday, which brings to mind a poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sally, having swallowed cheese, Directs down holes the scented breeze, Enticing thus with baited breath Nice mice to an untimely death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baited breath is a silly idea - what does one bait one's breath with? (Evidently cheese if one is a mousehunter). Why do we say this?</p>
<p>Well, to start with, the word is all wrong. It should have been &quot;bated breath&quot; instead of &quot;baited breath&quot;, which is the sort of misuse that tends to wildly annoy me. The term &quot;bated&quot; is from the french word &quot;batre&quot; which itself is from the latin &quot;battêre&quot;1. Bated is similar to a word you've almost definitely heard - &quot;abate&quot; - and this is almost certainly enough information for almost anyone who comes across this post.</p>
<p>This does bring to light another topic that I will likely cover, and that's the use and misuse of language. I'm no Chomsky, but I certainly have ideas about language and thought and the entanglement between the two, and I'm certain that you've noticed a plethora of words that are often given the descriptor &quot;five dollar.&quot; Etymology is a personal favourite topic - I love knowing where words come from - and the evolution of language is intensely interesting to me. Hence, a new category: <a href="/category/lingua-franca/">Lingua Franca</a>, which is about the differences in the common language we speak.</p>
<p>1 - Apologies for the circumflex instead of the breve - it's the best I can do with html codes.</p>
