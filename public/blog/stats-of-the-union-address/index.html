<p>Forgive the title, but I've been looking through my stats and have found some interesting things and made some decisions about design moving forward.</p>
<p>First up, screen resolution. Over 85% of people accessing my site did so at a resolution at or exceeding a width of 1280px. That's a change from even a year ago, when only about 65% of people ran at that resolution. It's nice to see upgrades happening.</p>
<p>Next, browsers. IE comes in rocking about 15% of total hits, which made me go <em>SQUEEEEEE</em>. That's an awesome number to see, and even better: IE6 usage at 0.87%.</p>
<p>Operating System was interesting - the overwhelming majority of people were using Windows (80%+) with Mac a &quot;close&quot; second at a little north of 15%. The other 4% was split roughly between linux and android. Of interest amongst Windows users, though, was the almost even split between XP and 7 (41% to 38%) with Vista a distant third.</p>
<p>Location was perhaps the most interesting thing for me, with nearly 40% of all traffic coming from the USA. Canada was a close second, and then the UK. From there, the list gets very interesting: India, Brazil, Phillipines, Russia, Australia, Malaysia, UAE.</p>
<p>Specific content that was accessed: mostly photos (about 80% of traffic was for photos).</p>
<p>So, I guess I'm going to aim at doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More future-facing (HTML5) website. Most users can handle it</li>
<li>More expansive design - I'll aim for 1280 wide but degrade nicely.</li>
<li>Better mobile version - some people are looking from mobile, should accommodate them.</li>
<li>More photos! I haven't touched my camera since my most recent familial addition. I should take more photos.</li>
</ul>
