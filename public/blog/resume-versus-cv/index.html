<p>I've been asked a few times why I have both a rÃ©sumÃ© and a CV when they're the same thing. Now, before I explain my reasoning, let me say this: I don't think that I'm necessarily correct and that the people who asked are incorrect. I merely would like to share my opinion and why I do things the way that I do.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're looking for someone to do web work for you, feel free to browse through my <a href="/resume/cv.html">Curriculum Vitae</a> and my <a href="/resume/resume.html">RÃ©sumÃ©</a>.</p>
<p>So, to start with, let's look at the meanings of the words:</p>
<p><em>Curriculum Vitae</em> is from the latin, meaning, roughly, &quot;Course of Life.&quot; Historically, this would be a recounting of one's life to that point and all the major things that one had achieved. This is what I mean when I talk about a CV - it is a summary of every job that I have ever worked at and what I feel that I accomplished thereat. For instance, I list the time that I spent working with my father, who is an independent contractor.</p>
<p><em>RÃ©sumÃ©</em>, on the other hand, is from the French verb &quot;rÃ©sumer&quot; which means something like &quot;to summarize&quot; although my french leaves something to be desired, even though it says on both my CV and my rÃ©sumÃ© that I speak it. My rÃ©sumÃ© is a summary of my curriculum vitae that I would normally tailor to each individual application to a job. Par example, I would not leave the construction worker entry when I worked with my father on the list when I applied to a coding job, unless it was a job in which I needed to be very patient (you'll have to read that part of the CV to get that).</p>
<p>Of interest to me now, then, is the common usage that has crept up around these words. Many places around the world use the words interchangeably, though a lot of british-influenced countries tend to use &quot;CVs&quot; more for what I think of as &quot;rÃ©sumÃ©s&quot;. The best theory that I've heard of what constitutes a CV or a rÃ©sumÃ© is from Chris over at <a href="http://www.technoblag.com">TechnoBlag</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows what a rÃ©sumÃ© is. A CV is just a rÃ©sumÃ© for academics or other people that think very highly of themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good enough for me... but I'm keeping my CV.</p>
