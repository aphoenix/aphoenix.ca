    <p>I didn't have any particular plans for this week, as I had met my goal by week 3. I didn't play as much and I revisited
one of the games that I had played in Week 3 - Truberbrook - to make some more progress. Guild of Dungeoneering and 
Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut both get mini-reviews.</p>

    <p>I've thought more on the games since my edits to last week's threads. This last week was a bit rough, and I spent more 
time in the evening playing video games than I should have. As a result, I have made it through my April goal, which was 
to play one game from each of the last 12 months of Humble Monthly Bundles. This was one of the best weeks - Evergarden,
Soul Calibur VI, Truberbrook, and a couple of others.</p>

    <p>A week into backlog burner and chill and I have made a lot of progress towards the goal of trying out a bunch of games
that were not on my radar at all before now. This is shaping up to be a fun event, and I will be trying to do more of 
these community created events. Surviving Mars, God's Trigger, Sonic Mania, Bad North are all up!</p>
