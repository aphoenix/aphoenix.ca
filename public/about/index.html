<h2 id="the-author">The Author</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Phoenix</strong> - 40ish, father of three, husband of one, President / CEO of <a href="https://media-doc.com">MediaDoc</a>.</p>
<p>I build sites and software on the internet. I like to use Python and TypeScript for that; I also use the standard things
that one often uses, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have been considered a &quot;WordPress Expert&quot;, though I would not 
describe myself as such, mostly because of self respect.</p>
<p>There are a lot of old writings here from 2005 - 2011. My areas of interest have changed since those years. I plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a bit about my interests: music, business, coding, maths, photography etc.</li>
<li>have a place I can direct my mother to when she asks what I want for a gift</li>
<li>explain some things that I've purchased over the years and how that's worked out</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to do a <a href="/tags/5/">5âœ­ Friday</a> about once a month, which I think is a good start.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>You can contact me - the easiest email is my firstname at thisdomain.</p>
<p>You can find me on github, reddit, tildes, or lobsters - my username matches the URL for this site.</p>
<p>You can find me on twitter: @andrewphoenix. </p>
<h2 id="this-site">This Site</h2>
<p>This site is generated using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and hosted on Amazon S3. It's optimized for Chrome, but
seems to work well in the other two browsers I use - Edge and Firefox.</p>
<p>This site uses almost no javascript, and there is very little in the way of tracking happening. I certainly do not
review any logs or anything; if you visit, it may be tracked in the bowels of Amazon, but I don't really see it. Feel
free to send me a message via any of the contact methods listed above. Note: in some past blog entries I talk about 
the analytics of the site somewhat, but I stopped tracking that years ago, and this is now mostly maintained for
myself, so I'm not particularly interested in which browsers are viewing things.</p>
<p>This site is intended to have a lo-fi, retro feel to it. The colour schemes should be reminiscent of a shag carpet that
was bought in the 80s.</p>
