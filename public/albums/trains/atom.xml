&lt;p&gt;I took this with my old Fuji Finepix a while ago. I set the camera down right on the tracks (obviously) and focused about 10 feet away. I quite like how it turned out - I think it feels pretty good - and it brought something to my attention. A lot of other photographers crop their photos quite a bit to get the perfect frame for their picture. I don&#x27;t know why, but I do not tend to do that - I frame it up first. Crop is one of the least used tools in my toolbox.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hrm. I wonder why that is?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
