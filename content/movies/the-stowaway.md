I like space dramas where there is some kind of issue that needs to get solved, and I like movies that present a moral
dilemma. This movie does both. The actors are all good, and the premise is good, but there are some serious flaws. At
any point, while doing a space walk, one should be tethered. This is an obvious thing to just about everyone who is
familiar with space dramas. There is a point at which the astronauts opt to *not* be tethered and to not tether
important cargo. This detail significantly reduced my enjoyment of the movie. Good premise, good actors, good direction,
big problems with writing.

I did have an interesting moment - I enjoy Toni Collette as an actress, and when she appeared, I wondered why they would
have her put on an Australian accent. I then also thought that her Australian accent was "a bit much". Imagine my
chagrin at the realization that this is her normal speaking voice, and I just always see her doing an American accent!
