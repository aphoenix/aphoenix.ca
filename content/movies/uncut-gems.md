I just finished watching Uncut Gems and if I had to sum the movie up, I would say this: it had a phenomenal cast with 
great acting. Every single person did a good job with their character. Every scene made sense and was important within 
the context of the movie. Every scene itself was well done, well acted, well directed. When everything was put together 
and I consider the sum of all these fantastic parts... I didn't enjoy the film. It was not a film that was built to be 
enjoyed, but endured.

If you're looking for an experience like that, then it's great. It's not really for me.
