# About

## The Author

**Andrew Phoenix** - 40ish, father of three, husband of one, President / CEO of [MediaDoc](https://media-doc.com).

I build sites and software on the internet. I like to use Python and TypeScript for that; I also use the standard things
that one often uses, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have been considered a "WordPress Expert", though I would not 
describe myself as such, mostly because of self respect.

There are a lot of old writings here from 2005 - 2011. My areas of interest have changed since those years. I plan to:

* write a bit about my interests: music, business, coding, maths, photography etc.
* have a place I can direct my mother to when she asks what I want for a gift
* explain some things that I've purchased over the years and how that's worked out

I plan to do a [5âœ­ Friday](/tags/5/) about once a month, which I think is a good start.

## This Site

This site is generated using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and hosted on Amazon S3. It's optimized for Chrome, but
seems to work well in the other two browsers I use - Edge and Firefox.

This site uses almost no javascript, and there is very little in the way of tracking happening. I certainly do not
review any logs or anything; if you visit, it may be tracked in the bowels of Amazon, but I don't really see it. Feel
free to send me a message via any of the contact methods listed above. Note: in some past blog entries I talk about 
the analytics of the site somewhat, but I stopped tracking that years ago, and this is now mostly maintained for
myself, so I'm not particularly interested in which browsers are viewing things.

This site is intended to have a lo-fi, retro feel to it. The colour schemes should be reminiscent of a shag carpet that
was bought in the 80s.
