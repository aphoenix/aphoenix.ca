# A brief introduction

I'm **Andrew Phoenix** - father of three, husband of one, coder, cook, musician, small business owner, game enthusiast. 
These are my musings, photos, and other digital chattels.
 
Most of the writing here is from 2012 and earlier. I'm hoping to change that.  
The retro 80s colour scheme is on purpose.
