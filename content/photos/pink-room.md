![Strangely lighted picture with pink overtones (wedding reception)](/photos/PinkRoom.jpg)

At a recent wedding, I was taking pictures with fairly long exposure times (the room was mostly black) and letting the lights that the DJ had set up define the lighting that I ended up with. This one is my favourite of those. Note to self: photography while drunk gives you many, many bad pictures.
