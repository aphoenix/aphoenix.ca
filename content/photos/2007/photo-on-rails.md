![photo taken with camera sitting on the train tracks, showing gravel and greenery and tracks into the distance](/photos/2007/PhotoOnRails.jpg "no Ruby here.  Move along.")

I took this with my old Fuji Finepix a while ago. I set the camera down right on the tracks (obviously) and focused about 10 feet away. I quite like how it turned out - I think it feels pretty good - and it brought something to my attention. A lot of other photographers crop their photos quite a bit to get the perfect frame for their picture. I don't know why, but I do not tend to do that - I frame it up first. Crop is one of the least used tools in my toolbox.

Hrm. I wonder why that is?
