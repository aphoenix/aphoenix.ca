This photo is one that I'm not sure of. I like it, but it feels a little like a wash. I liked it enough after I took it to mark it for my photoblog, though...

It certainly works better as a black and white - the colours were washed out, but the shading is actually not bad. But you lose the vibrancy of sunset in black and white.

Yeah, I don't know.
