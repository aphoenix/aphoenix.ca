![Two lonely dandelions underneath some trees.](/photos/DandelionWishers.jpg "And thus began the scrollover popups.  I'm sitting in the bullring having a chicken caesar right now.")

This scene caught my eye and I'm not sure why. I saw the dandelions, but I was quite far away (this is zoomed in as far as I could). I was also stopped in my car at a red light at the time. In the middle of Guelph. That's right, Guelph looks like this.
