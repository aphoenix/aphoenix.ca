![mustang's front end, little horse thing](/photos/StangsFrontEnd.jpg "my car")

This is my car. Well, one small part of it. 

_Edit from 2020: 14 years on - I just got rid of this car last year. I'm still sad about it. It was easily the best car 
I have ever owned, and I expect I will always think that._
