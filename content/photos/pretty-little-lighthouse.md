This lighthouse shot is taken from inside Pier 21 in Halifax. Pier 21 is where immigrants came into Canada for many, many years (my mother, in fact, came through Pier 21). The island that this lighthouse calls home is where many Acadians were exiled to in the sixteen and seventeen hundreds. It's really not very big though, eh?
