Photo dates: the idea is that you and your partner go for a walk and pick things to take pictures of. You both take pictures of the same thing and then compare them and look at the differences. This is an arch in downtown Guelph at the River Run Centre and the hand of the woman I love.

**Editors Note (2021)**: this picture was from 15 years ago. Several years later, I married the woman attached to that
hand and we had our wedding reception in the place that we had this date, and we took wedding pictures in the exact
window still where she is holding the glass. *Photo dates work*.
