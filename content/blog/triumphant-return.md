A new theme for the website is basically exactly the thing to get over my hiatus from blogging. The new theme is a single column layout, and I'm torn between emphasizing photos and emphasizing blog entries. Both are displaying well, but I'm not sure which one should come first. Any preferences?

I'm also working on a nifty little widget to let you select which stylesheet design you want to display in your browser. I'm retooling the HTML in XHTML 1.1 Strict and I think I should be able to back-port the current and old CSS to display nicely, though it'll take a little bit of extra work. My main challenge and motivation here is this: I've designed the HTML to be agnostic of how things look and I'm trying to avoid any kludgy hacks to get things displaying right. I know I'm not the world's best graphics designer, but once again all graphics will have been drawn and created by me.
