I guess I have taken up fermenting hot sauces, as seems customary during a pandemic. I've made and bottled my first one, 
and while I do not have the best tools for the job yet, I am hoping to procure some. t's quite a lot like sriracha, but 
a bit fruitier and quite a bit spicier. I did boil it, but I think not quite enough, because I don't think the 
fermentation has completely stopped (you can see I put a fermentation lid on in the picture). I think I'm going to try 
doing this again in the future, next time I have extra hot peppers.

**The Recipe** which I mostly made it up as I went. Be warned the word "yeast" figures prominently.

1. Obtain through some means, a bunch of hot peppers. Mine were from a local farm. I also had a few that we grew in our
very own home garden. The peppers I used were "cherry bomb" peppers and thai hot peppers.
2. Cut off the stems. Turns out it's also important to cut off the opposite terminus end if you want to avoid 
   yeastiness. I also added a slice of peach (not a great idea, makes extra yeast).
3. Put all of the above in a brine. I used kosher salt and water. I didn't really measure, I just went with gut feelings.
4. Realize that the fermentation lids you bought are the wrong size, and order a different jar, but while waiting for 
   that new bigger wide mouth jar to arrive, butcher two of the lids to go onto the smaller jar.
5. Weigh down the peppers so that they're under the brine. This is *important* and I didn't do it well enough, and 
   things got extra yeasty as a result.
6. Wait a couple of days.
7. When the new jar arrives, bemoan the fact that once again the jar is the wrong frigging size, but just roll with it.
8. Filter out some yeast while transferring to the new jar. Retain the brine, strain it in a sieve, then strain it 
   through cheesecloth, then strain it through a coffee filter. Pack the peppers in tightly, then weigh them down 
   properly. Poke holes in the lid for the big jar, and then cover the holes with cheesecloth.
9. Wait like a week or so.
10. When things look so yeasty that you're like "do I throw this out?" then do the thing with the yeast again - strain 
    it, sieve it, filter it, retain the brine
11. Rinse the peppers, then put them in a good size pot. Add a bit of strained, de-yeasted brine and a bit of apple 
    cider vinegar. Bring it to a boil.
    
That's it, that's the recipe. Enjoy!
