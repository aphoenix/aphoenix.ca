One of my favourite blogs to read is [Tim Bray's Ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) - and this is a funny lead in to my first music post, because Tim is very much a technophile (for instance, he was recently [featured on the cover of Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/151), and on the inside too!). One of my favourite recurring themes is his "5✭♫" posts, in which he expounds on various musics that he listens to.

If the title looks broken, you should [Get Firefox](http://tools.google.com/firefox/toolbar/bundle/). It's the simplest way to fix it.

So, in the spirit of thievery Open Source Ideas, I'm going to implement something similar. Right now it's called "5✭ Fridays" and I'm going to tell you a bit about what I'm listening to... and at this moment it's the Misfits (warning: the Misfits may be offensive).

The Misfits are a great punk band. I'll tell you right now that, even though I'm _in_ a punk band, it's not a genre of music that I listen to regularly. Punk's great, but I tend to want a bit more, um, _music_ in my music. There's often a wall of sound and some yelling, and lots of double kick drum riffs, and a bass player that rakes the strings constantly, and it gets old quick. Also, even though I have a lot of rage, it's mostly a quiet, vitriolic, smoldering rage that lends itself more to Metal or Franz Liszt. I'm not "anti-establishment" either; the man's not keeping me down and I don't have a yearning for anarchy. The Misfits carve right through all the problems that I have by using angry but harmonic guitars and establishing strong melodic vocals singing B-movie themed lyrics that are as apt to make you laugh as to incite anger in you. Here's "Resurrection" (beware the mild sacrilege)

> Complications inside of me reminds me that my heart won't always beat The ugly face of death that's smiling at my rotting teeth
> 
> I will die here in this sorrow I was waiting for tomorrow Palpitate the pulse until you feel my heart explode against the wall
> 
> Talk about me, Laugh about me cry about me... nail me to the cross I'll be a martyr for the hated, the weak, the ugly, the lost
> 
> I will die here in this sorrow I won't wait for tomorrow Palpitate the pulse until you resurrect my soul from the wall

Zombie much? To go with this, they have an astoundingly catchy melody and a powerful guitar riff, which is one of the most used chord progressions in history - but it works. It's got a beat that's hard to, well, beat, and it gets my head bobbing along every time I hear the song.

The Misfits have this tendency to eschew writing lots of lyrics, which may be a biproduct of the fact that their songs tend to be under two minutes in length. "Resurrection" runs 1:29 and goes all-out for the duration. Another Misfits song that is amongst my favourites is "The Haunting" which clocks in at 1:27 and is basically a 40 second song with a repeat. It's not a complicated song, but they're not a complicated band, and sometimes it's not about complication; the gestalt is more than the sum of its parts. There are only five chords in "The Haunting", but they're the _right_ five chords, and they're supported by the powerful melody and the intense energy.

If you are interested in trying punk out for a spin, but want less noise and more melody, as many people often do, you would be hardpressed to find a better package than the Misfits. Besides, if you don't like them, the song will be done in just a minute.
