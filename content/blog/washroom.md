Well, I've gone and done it. I've bought a house. And, of course, the first thing one has to do when one buys a house is to rip out a large portion of the crappy work that someone else has done and put good work back into it.

All I have to say is this: I'm very lucky my father is a contractor.

We pulled out all of the upstairs washroom on the weekend (we took possession on Friday) including all the fixtures, most of the walls, insulation... it was a big destructo-fest. It was actually a lot of fun, except I'm still in a little bit of pain from all the working (try swinging a crowbar over your head at a wall for a while and see how you feel!). I'm hoping to do some before and after pictures once we get to the actual "after" phase.

I think that the washroom is going to be great - we have some good ideas about what we want to do - and we'll be slowly doing some other things to the house over the course of the next few years. I'll probably be posting about these when they happen, so I've added this category ("Renovations").

Yay! House!
