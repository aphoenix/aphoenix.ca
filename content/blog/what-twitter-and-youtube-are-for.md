I started to follow [@OldSpice](http://www.twitter.com/oldspice) today, and I have learned what Twitter and YouTube were put on the planet for.

Twitter and YouTube were created so that [@OldSpice](http://www.twitter.com/oldspice) on a horse man would have a place, nay, a kingdom. It's his internet, I just live in it.

In all seriousness, I have never seen an ad campaign as effective as this one. I now have 3 bars of [Denali](http://www.oldspice.com/products/product/102/Old_Spice_Fresh_Collection_AntiperspirantDeodorant_Denali/) at home. Two of them are open, so I can do both sides at once.
