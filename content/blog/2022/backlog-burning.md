I wrote some posts about Tildes Backlog Burner event for 2020 - [here is the tag](/tags/game-backlog-burner/) 
to read all the articles, past, present, and future - and it ran again this past february. I took part, and wrote a bit
about some games I've tried out this past month.

## [Sunless Skies: Sovereign Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/596970/Sunless_Skies_Sovereign_Edition/)

This game hits a lot of good notes for me. There's lots of story to explore, lots of lore to learn, lots of *weird shit*
happening all over the place. If you're looking for a top-down, original GTA style, steampunk, gothic cosmic horror rpg 
where you pilot a steam engine through space, then this is the game for you.

This game is a sequel, and I have not played the original. That has not been a problem; I don't think that I am lost as
a result, though I have, at times, felt lost, but that's because I have been well and truly *lost* because of the 
aforementioned piloting a steam engine through space. It's notable that I'm pretty sure that the maps are unique to
your playthrough, so you can't just look up where specific ports are, which contributes to sometimes feeling lost. In
this case, the ability to feel lost is a definite plus.

The art style is good, the story is good, piloting a flying steam engine through an alternate world filled with sky 
monsters is great. One other great thing is that the game has "rolls" for a lot of the RPG elements, but thus far I have 
not experienced any story elements being locked behind those rolls, which is something that really turned me off Disco 
Elysium. If you fail a roll, instead of just not progressing, you do whatever you were doing badly and there is a 
drawback; you often lose some of a particular resource - there are several that you must balance, being fuel, supplies, 
terror, nightmares, crew - and you are left dealing with the consequence. For example, if your Nightmare level is 
sufficiently high, you may have a terrible nightmare, that you have to try to deal with emotionally; if you succeed, you 
may increase your Terror level; if you fail, you may increase the Terror level, or decide you have to turn on more 
lights, which burns more fuel.

There is also an option to play "Legacy" mode, which means that if you die - and there are a plethora of ways to do 
that - then your captain is capital-D Dead forever, but luckily bequeaths quests and some relevant items to a new 
captain. On my first run, I didn't quite get it, and I started again, and thus far my new captain has not died.

Overall, this is a delight. I recommend it without reservation if you like RPGs, especially if you have any interest in
cosmic horror or steampunk.

## [Hydroneer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106840/Hydroneer/)

My son requested that I try out Hydroneer, which is a mining sandbox game where you dig for ore and gems to get money
to more efficiently dig for ore and gems to get money to more efficiently... well you get the idea. My son's enjoyment 
probably stems from some [Let's Game It Out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q) videos - he loves 
that channel - and he really likes to try out game-breaking things that he sees, so one of the first things we did was 
try to find a way to generate "infinite money" by blowing up fish. It did technically work, but it was time-consuming; I 
ended up spending some time showing him another "hack" to get infinite money, which was just selling the fish instead of 
blowing it up.

There isn't currently any multiplayer, so when we play "together" we're just playing two single player games near each 
other, but it's still fun to do that. We've both got little mining setups, and he has liked showing me the ropes, being 
the one who knows the game a bit more.

It's a cute game - the world is nice, there's stuff to try to figure out, you can make custom houses and crafting areas. 
The mining itself is a bit grindy, though after some time you don't really mine anymore anyways. It's a cool indie game, 
and the guy who made it is pretty active with the community and quite approachable. It's well worth the 9 bucks I think 
I spent on it.

## [The Beginner's Guide](https://store.steampowered.com/app/303210/The_Beginners_Guide/)

I also experienced - note I do not use the term "played" - The Beginner's Guide, which is a game by the creator of 
[The Stanley Parable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable/). I may not have been in the right 
headspace for this; it took about 90 minutes, and it is not really a game, but something you work through with the 
narrator. The Stanley Parable is a 5âœ­ game for me, so I guess I did have some level of expectation, but the experience
overall was... well I think that giving this a rating as a game is almost orthogonal to the point. There are youtube 
videos that are playthroughs of the game, and you will get exactly the same experience out of watching those 
playthroughs as you will get from having the game and doing it yourself, so I would recommend doing that if you are 
interested, unless you want to spend the 11 bucks to support the creator, which is also a good idea.

## [Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/409160/Dr_Langeskov_The_Tiger_and_The_Terribly_Cursed_Emerald_A_Whirlwind_Heist/)

This game is delightful and cute, and I do not mean that in any way negatively. It is not particularly *deep* - you will
not get hours of gameplay out of it (I mean that literally, less than 120 minutes of time, total), but playing through
is fun. This scratched a *Stanley Parable* itch that I had that *The Beginner's Guide* did not. Voice acting was great,
the concept is fun, and it's free, so pick it up and try it out.
