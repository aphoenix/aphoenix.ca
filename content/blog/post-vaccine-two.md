## A minor note

I will attempt to refrain from engaging with anti-vaccination nutbaggery from here on out. I have made a conscious
decision to avoid it online and in life, and I'm just... done. I feel like this pandemic has made it very clear which
groups of people are reasonable and which groups of people aren't, and it's also made clear who we can live with and
who we can live without.

I will probably not be perfect in this endeavour; letting go of arguments is not something I have ever been good at.
