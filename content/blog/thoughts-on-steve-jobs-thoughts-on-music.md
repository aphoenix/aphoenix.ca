Steve Jobs and I frequently do not see things eye to eye. I am certainly not a Mac fanboy - as evidence, I submit my seething hatred of iTunes - and I think Stevey's got his own little despot that people don't attack as much as Bill's because Macs are fashionable. Full disclosure - I have a Mac and I like it. I don't love it, yet, but I certainly like it quite a bit.

Stevey, though, sometimes gets things right. Wander on over to [Thoughts on Music](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/) at [Apple.com](http://www.apple.com) and give that a read. I can boil it down to one thought:

_90% of music is sold DRM free, in the form of CDs‡. Why do music companies insist on selling their online music crippled by DRM?_

Well, Stevey. You've get one hell of a large lever there. Why don't you push on it and see what happens?

† - sorry 'bout the rendering bug up there! \[Edit: rendering bug fixed!\] ‡ - as long as you don't buy from Sony
