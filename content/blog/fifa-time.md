For the next month or so, my family and I have decided that we cheer for Africa!

**Go South Africa! Go Ghana! Go Cameroon! Go CÃ´te d'Ivoire!**

Unfortunately, because of rampant [Advance Fee Fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_fraud) I just can't cheer for Nigeria. (this is said pertly, tongue in cheek, and just for fun).
