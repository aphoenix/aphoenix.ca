I'm an avid, if amateur, cook, and I'd like to share a few recipes that I've come up with. Feel free to make these, but remember my creative commons license, which covers everything on this blog! If you make these for a restaurant, I get to eat them for free.

**Ingredients**

3 large White or Gold potatoes 1 large Red Pepper 1 tbsp ground Sea Salt [Club House Greek Spice](http://www.clubhouse-canada.com/productdetail.cfm?ID=10344) to taste ½ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

**Preparation**

1\. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). 2. Cut potatoes and red pepper into one inch cubes / squares as appropriate and place in roasting pan. 3. Add salt, Greek Spice and olive oil. Toss potatoes and peppers, making sure that there is some spice on each potato. Be liberal with the spice. I typically use at least ¼ bottle. 4. Bake at 425 for one hour. For crispier potatoes, bake at 425 for 50 minutes, then broil for 10 - 15 minutes. Serves 4.
