I have downloaded iTunes. I have downloaded WinAmp. We'll see if either of these applications has grown in me in the last 3 years.

Please note that tomorrow's 5✭ Friday may be a little late, as the problems I'm having with MusikCube means that all my music ratings and metadata are gone (on 8000+ songs), so I no longer know what's _in_ my 5✭ category.
