Over the last 24 hours, I have had lunch, dinner and am about to have breakfast.

Lunch: Went to turtle jack's and had a peppercorn burger with sauteed mushrooms with a side salad. See? Salad. An attempt at faux-healthiness. Or something. Oh, and a pint of Rickard's Red.

Dinner: Spicy beef curry with naan bread. I made the curry and it was just a tad _too_ spicy for my liking (which should tell you something). It consisted of very lean ground beef (from a butcher - very high quality angus beef), green and wax beans, carrots, a panoply of spices (too much chili!) and some milk to smooth out the sauce. With dinner I had a Sleeman India Pale Ale. Hrm. A beer with 2 meals - that doesn't happen very often.

Breakfast this morning will consist of the standard bullring breakfast #2 (oatmeal and a coffee). That's on the schedule for 9:30.
