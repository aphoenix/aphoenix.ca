Last night when I got home I went on another fairly short bike ride with a different path.

This one is about 2 km by my estimation.

Last night I was tired so I punked out and only did 40 crunches and 10 pushups. This morning I planned to take Path #1 again, but with the wind chill factor, it was about -8Â°C, which was just too cold. So I did 50 crunches and 20 pushups before a quick shower and a trip to work.
