I found a fantastic resource for people that are interested in photography and are on the lookout for new lenses:

[Photozone Lens Reviews](http://photozone.de/8Reviews/index.html) has a boatload of reviews, that seem to be spot on - they've reviewed all the lenses that I've used for my XTi, and we seem to see eye-to-eye on all of them.

Check them out if you need to buy a lens!
