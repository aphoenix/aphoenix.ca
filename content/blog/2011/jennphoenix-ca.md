I spent about 40 minutes earlier this week designing and deploying [JennPhoenix.ca](http://www.jennphoenix.ca) for my sister, who does piano lessons. \[caption id="attachment\_467" align="alignright" width="400" caption="Jenn's New Piano website"\][![JennPhoenix.ca Screenshot](http://www.aphoenix.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/jennphoenix.png "jennphoenix")](http://www.aphoenix.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/jennphoenix.png)\[/caption\]

Probably the things that are most of interest to highlight: I used some free icon packs, which I will be attributing in the next version of this website, which I found via [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com). I found the repeating background image using [AVA7 Patterns](http://patterns.ava7.com/) which I will also be attributing (they also do not require attribution, but I like attribution when it makes sense). I've got a contact form ready to go using [Jquery Contactable](http://theodin.co.uk/blog/ajax/contactable-jquery-plugin.html) but I was trying not to do any PHP for this site, so I haven't actually made it happen yet. I guess I could replace the PHP with something else. For the font in the header, I use a [Google Web Font](http://www.google.com/webfonts/), which is awesome.

The breakdown on time spent is as follows:

- Write the html and content. ~10 min
- Come up with design. ~15min
- Find icons / fonts / resources. ~10 min
- Write the css. ~5 min

Altogether, I'm happy with how this microsite turned out
