I was exceptionally hungry this morning, so I partook of the standard bullring breakfast #1, which is an egg sandwich with bacon, cheese and tomato. I also had a large double-double coffee. All told, not particularly healthy, but I'm not planning on feeling guilty over it.

For those who are interested, standard bullring breakfast #2 is a bowl of instant Quaker Oatmeal and a large double-double coffee. Yes, I loves me my coffees.
