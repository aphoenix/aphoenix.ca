I'm a latecomer to the [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net) game, but I'm looking for a strong finish.

I've been trying to hone my Python skills, so I [Dove Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.org) with a vengeance. That didn't quite sate my desire for crazy coding fun, and my good buddy [Sean](http://www.seanyo.ca) suggested the [Infamous FizzBuzz test](http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/).

Well, I loved it, and I searched for more similar problems, and I got to the first Project Euler question:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

I was thrilled! A minor modification to my fizzbuzz program and I was off and running. I've currently completed somewhere around 20... but I'll admit that I've skipped to the end am trying my hand at Problem 282, the dreaded Ackermann Function.

So - if you're a coder, why don't you try it out?
