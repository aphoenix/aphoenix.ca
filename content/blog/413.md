According to the CBC [G8/G20 costs have grown exponentially](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/06/23/g8-g20-cost-parliamentary-budget-office-report.html). I can only infer that if the first 3 days cost $1,000,000,000, then the next 3 days will cost $1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (the cost squared, typically the smallest of what is considered exponential growth). That's unfortunate, because I think that's more money than the entire world has, so we're probably all going to starve to death now.
