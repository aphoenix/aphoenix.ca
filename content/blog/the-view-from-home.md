![A view of a street in Guelph, with a girl riding a bicycle.](/photoblog/photos/2007/TheViewFromHome.jpg "Zoooooooooomed right in.")

I don't know why I like this photo so much - I think it's because of how _normal_ it feels. Just another shot of suburbia.

I had to post this one sooner rather than later because of the whole "moving into a new house" thing.
