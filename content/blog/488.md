In a nutshell, here's the problem with posting a link to something you strenuously disagree with using social media. It's all the success metric. When you link to something, you're basically giving it your vote of approval. If the thing that you are linking to is bad, harmful or stupid, then you need to find a way to remove that vote of approval. The easiest way to do this is to find an actual website that you can link to from your social media (a blogger blog or a personal site, or something of this nature) and put up, in 500 words or less, your major gripes with whatever it is you disagree with. Then, construct a link to the material that you disagree with to go at the beginning of the article. Craft it like this:

«a href="link to the article" rel="nofollow"»This article is wrong.«/a»

You're robbing the article of gravity, and your contribution to the success metric of the site (almost always number of clicks) is going to be tempered by the fact that whoever is doing analysis will see that they are getting traffic from a link that explains why they are wrong, and does not give their article any credence. That rel="nofollow" basically says "I'm sending you here but not because it is good."
