Begins tonight. I'm not sure how long it is going to take me, but it's not an insignificant task. I think I've learned something - don't assume that your blog posts are going to have the same format forever!

Photos will likely not be working for a while, and I think I'm going to change categories into tags. Even though, at some level, for some reason, I don't like tags.

Grr. Tags.
