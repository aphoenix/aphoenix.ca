This blog is quickly falling by the wayside because of life. There's a number of updates and upgrades I want to make to it:

- Complete overhaul to the theme - let's face it, this isn't the most visually stunning blog in the world. I did this CSS as an interesting exercise to make a 2-column extremely liquid layout. Test it out - change the text size, and the pagination all remains the same. Whoop-de-doo. I'm likely going to stay with black and white, but I _hope_ I'll end up with something prettier.
- I want to integrate the photoblog into the main site and start posting to it again. I have quite the backlog of photos waiting to be posted.
- I really want to get 5✭ Fridays back up and running, but here's the problem - there's not enough 5✭ music to go around. I think we might end up with a general music review on Fridays. And they might not be on Friday.
- More Pages!

That's about it. Maybe you'll see a change in the near future. Maybe not. It all depends on how lazy motivated I am.
