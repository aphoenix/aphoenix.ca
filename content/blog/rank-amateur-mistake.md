I came to the realization that something was wrong with my site this morning, and while looking into it, I realized I had made the mistake of a rank amateur web designer.

I just reinstalled Ubuntu on my computer, and I have been customizing it to make it look how I want it to look. Among the customizations is the default text colour - it ended up being set to quite a light blue (my backgrounds are all dark in the theme I've created). I fired up firefox, and was about to get to customizing. I always set my default home page to [APhoenix.ca](http://www.aphoenix.ca), and I realized that I could barely read the text. It took me a moment to figure out why, but it turns out that I never set a text colour for the site and it was just pulling in the default text colour of the computer it was rendered on!

This has been fixed. My apologies.
