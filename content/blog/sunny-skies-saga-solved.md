There has been follow up from \[redacted\]:

> I do remember taking a picture similar a while back. While it was similar, you are right that it might not have been the same one. Sorry about that. I'll try to dig up my picture for conformation.

Five minutes later, I received this:

> I have found the picture on my old computer. While it is extremely similar, there are not any trees at the bottom and there are less clouds.
> 
> I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but accidents do occur sometimes.

Interesting way things turned out.

For all you crazy kids out there, I have one small piece of advice: it is better to hold your tongue and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. When you think you have found copyright infringement on things that you own, double check to make sure that the person in question has actually infringed on your intellectual property before accusing them of thieving and lying. It is good to check your facts so you don't end up looking truly foolish.

And \[redacted\], if you are reading this, there are no hard feelings on my end of things.
