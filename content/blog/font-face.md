I am on the fence with @font-face. I've noticed more and more (after it was pointed out to me by [Nick](http://www.sinnick.com)) that when you use @font-face, the text displays and then will, after a brief pause, morph into the selected font. Every time I see that happen, I want to use @font-face slightly less.

On the other hand, the web would be so much prettier if I could just add "@font-face: Aller" to every page.

(this didn't quite fit in a tweet, so it had to live here)
