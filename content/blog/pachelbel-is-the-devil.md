Every mean thing I've ever wanted to say about Pachelbel's Canon in D is said much better in this YouTube clip from Rob Paravonian.

The Video formerly found here, is still available from [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/v/JdxkVQy7QLM).

I would happily write more, but Paravonian says everything worth saying. Of note: I have made several of these jokes before but I was never able to string them all together like this guy.
