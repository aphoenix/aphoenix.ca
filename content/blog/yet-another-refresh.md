It is time once more to refresh [Aphoenix.ca](/). I spent a bit of time recently taking part in a project called 
[TiMaSoMo](https://tildes.net/~tildes/spo/announcing_tildes_make_something_month_timasomo_for_2020). Tildes Makes
Something Month. I elected to once again remake this website. This time around, I decided to use a static website
generated called [Zola](https://getzola.org). I've been retroactively adding things that I've written over the last 8 
years since my last official entry, and I'll probably continue doing so.

<!-- more -->

The things that I am mostly happy with are the blog entries and the photo entries. I'm planning on adding some more
sections:

* a place for brief movie reviews. I have been writing them, but the section in general isn't ready.
* a place to list "gear" i.e. things that I own, and my opinions on them
* a wishlist 0 my mom frequently asks me for lists of potential gifts

These other elements will get added as I have time - perhaps over Christmas, since we're not going to be doing much in
the way of visiting.
