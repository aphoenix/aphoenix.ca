As you may or may not have noticed, I've overhauled aphoenix.ca. This used to be a fairly static website with a few extra odds and ends (like the photoblog) available to peruse. The plan is as follows:

Monday is "Left Brain" day and you'll probably have something fairly technical to see here. Friday is "Right Brain" day and you'll find a post that is fairly music oriented. Wednesday and Weekend days are photoblog days. You'll see a (hopefully) pretty picture.

Functionality that is on the horizon includes comments and trackbacks, as well as registration if you're interested.
