# Aphoenix.ca

This is the entire contents of [aphoenix.ca](https://aphoenix.ca), which I
build to help me with figuring out [Zola](https://getzola.org), a static
site generator.

If you, for some reason, want to build a copy of this website, then I
guess go for it? You'll need Zola, as mentioned above; you can run it
locally with `zola serve` or use `zola build` to actually create the
static site itself.
